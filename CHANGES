==== 1.4.0 ====

- make add_to_storage signature consistent on all implementations (args and kwargs were missing for some)
- Add support for cassandra-driver 3.2.0+
- Use extras_require pip feature instead of custom install arguments

==== 1.3.5 ====

- Fix ignored redis_server timeline parameter

==== 1.3.4 ====

- faster deserialization for Cassandra feeds (skip ORM layer during serialization)
- optional cassandra install
- allow to use cassandra-driver v3 via install option

Breaking changes:
-----------------

Cassandra users:
    * activity serializers now get a dictionary instead of a CQL model instances when loading data
    * feeds' timelines that implements get_slice_from_storage now must return a dict instead of CQL model instance


==== 1.3.3 ====

- easier test setup
- add default protocol_version for Cassandra (v2)
- default serialization_id for aggregated activities is now with millisecond resolution
- add built-in sorting to Activity class

==== 1.3.2 ====

- support for using stream-framework with cassandra-driver 3.0.0. this enables support for cassandra 3.3

==== 1.3.1 ====

- update cassandra driver to 2.7.2

==== 1.3.0 ====

- removed feedly legacy module
- move to cassandra driver 2.7 (CQLEngine dev happens on the driver since 2.5)

==== 1.2.0 ====

- python 2.7 and 3.4 support

==== 1.1.3 ====

- remove batch inserts for cassandra backend, move to async parallel statements
- millisecond timestamp resolution
- manager's follow_user method now respects async parameter
- custom cassandra models are now easy to use

==== 1.1.2 ====

- Fixed potential memory leak with memoize decorator (Cassandra only)

==== 1.1.1 ====

- fixed pypi link to github

==== 1.1.0 ====

- Support activity_id (asc and desc) sorting for Redis backed feeds (thanks to Anislav)
- Configurable aggregated feeds update_seen_at and update_read_at fields
- Faster redis counts (using ZCARD instead of ZCOUNT -inf +inf)

Breaking changes:
----------------
Aggregated activities update_seen_at and update_read_at attributes are not stored in UTC by default

==== 1.0.1 ====

- Fixes some legacy feedly names in code
- Better documentation

==== 1.0.0 ====

- Renamed from Feedly to Stream Framework
- Feedly install via pypi will be supported till 22-01-2015
- The new package is available on pypi here https://pypi.python.org/pypi/stream_framework/
- And support the from feedly import * syntax till 19-03-2015
